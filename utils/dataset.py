class AnnotationDataset(torch.utils.data.Dataset):
    """A PyTorch Dataset that deterministically pre-assigns mixing/noise flags to ensure
    consistency across epochs. Mixing and noise indices are sampled once during initialization.

    This dataset reads annotations from a Parquet file, filters by dataset split (train/valid/test),
    and supports on-the-fly transformations. 

    Args:
        annot_path (str): Path to the Parquet file containing annotations with columns:
            - `path`: Image file paths.
            - `target`: Class labels.
            - `set`: Dataset split ('train', 'valid', or 'test').

        what_set (Literal['train', 'valid', 'test']): Which dataset split to load.

        transform (Optional[caugs.Compose]): Albumentations-style augmentation pipeline.

        image_mix_prob (Optional[float]): Probability of an image being marked for mixing
            (only used in 'train' mode). Must satisfy `image_mix_prob + noise_prob <= 1`.

        noise_prob (Optional[float]): Probability of an image being marked for noise injection
            (only used in 'train' mode). Must satisfy `image_mix_prob + noise_prob <= 1`.

    Raises:
        AssertionError: If `image_mix_prob + noise_prob > 1.0` during initialization.
        FileNotFoundError: If an image file cannot be loaded.

    Returns:
        Tuple[torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor]: A tuple containing:
            - `image`: Transformed image tensor (C, H, W).
            - `label`: Class label tensor (dtype=torch.long).
            - `image_mix`: Boolean tensor (1 if image is marked for mixing).
            - `noise`: Boolean tensor (1 if image is marked for noise injection).
